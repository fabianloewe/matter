# The Matter Language

Matter is a _compiler creating language \(a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)\)_ for easily building parsers, [ASTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), interpreters and, of course, compilers in one simple language. Wether you want to work on an existing programming language or create your own one, Matter helps you and saves you time.

##### All features in short:

* [x] Static typed and [type-inferred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference) language
* [x] Simple syntax inspired by Ruby and Python
* [x] Clear seperation of each part \(_parsing_, _AST generation_ and _compilation_\) while still keeping all together in its type \(see the [Documentation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/hyronx/matter-lang/details)\)

##### And the in-progress and upcoming ones:

* \[in progress\] Machine code compiled for best performance \(through LLVM\)
* \[upcoming\] Integration of custom parsers for your compiler \(through an C interface\)
* \[upcoming\] Compilation support for other platforms beside machine code like the JVM or .NET \(through an C interface\)
* \[upcoming\] One large type base you can use in custom languages or compiler existing one, too
